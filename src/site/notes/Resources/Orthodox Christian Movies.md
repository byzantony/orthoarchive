The picture unfolds a wide panorama of the life in Russia at the beginning of the 15th century, when the Russian genius artist Andrei Rublev lived and worked. His creations showed the world a miracle of harmony, beauty, light, hope - and all this at a time when the country is torn apart by princely civil strife, and Tatar raids, famine and pestilence are chasing the people. The film is divided into eight short stories, which have little plot connection with each other, but paint a general picture of medieval Russia, which is taking shape like a mosaic work. The film was included in the 100 best films in the history of cinema, according to a survey of film critics of the world in 1978.

"The Island" is a 2006 Russian biographical film about a 20th century Eastern Orthodox monk. Pyotr Mamonov, who plays the lead character, formerly a rock musician in the USSR, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy in the 1990s and lives now in an isolated village. Film director Pavel Lungin said about him that "to a large extent, he played himself." Mamonov was first very hesitant to play in the film, but then was urged by his confessor to play the character. After the filming, one of the movie crew staff decided to stay on the island and live there as a hermit.

This movie is about how a murderer can repent and become a monk. Just like any other person described in the Bible who sinned, repented deep in his/her heart, and became a Saint. This too is possible for any other sinner in the world, no matter how big his/her sin is, God's mercy is bigger if the sinner is willing to repent. 

A short analysis of the movie: The main character Maxim (atheist at first), who was a Red Army spy and killed a priest, and wanted to kill the Finnish General (who also was an atheist), after living with the monks, became an Orthodox Christian monk himself. The Finnish General told him to go with God's mercy. In other words (the atheist Finnish General felt that God does exist, and acknowledged Him), not even knowing that Maxim wanted to kill him, a few seconds before that. Maxim understood that he could've got killed at that moment, but wasn't, because of God's mercy. Even the Finnish Captain who wanted Maxim to kill the Finnish General, when he was shot at the end of the movie and felt that he is going to die, started to pray the prayer "Our Father in heaven".

The film begins in June 1941 in the backwater village of Tikhoe in Latvia. Priest Alexander carries out the duties of his ministry, helped by his wife, Alevtina. Two days later the Nazi invaders enter the village. The Nazi invaders are keen to reopen the Orthodox churches closed by the Soviet authorities. Alexander is offered a mission to the Pskov oblast. An Orthodox church building, confiscated and turned into a hall for film showings and the like, is restored to its former use, the church bell rescued from the lake etc. However life under the Nazis is ambiguous and the priest must walk a tightrope (metaphorically) between faithful Christian service and loyalty to his country and people. A poignant scene is the Easter service, celebrated along with Red Army POWs surrounded by German guards. Alexander and Alevtina also harbour Jewish orphans. Alevtina falls ill from contact with the POWs and puts the children first by losing herself in a snowstorm lest she infect the orphans. The plot concludes with the Soviet authorities back in power and the priest imprisoned by the NKVD. The epilogue shows the priest decades later, visited by the orphans he saved many years before.
