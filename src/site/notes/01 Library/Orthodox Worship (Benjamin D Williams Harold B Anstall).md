### Description
The Orthodox liturgy a living continuity with the worship of Judaism (temple and synagogue) and the Early Church. Written in a non-theological manner for the average lay person, this book offers inspired insights into the Orthodox liturgy. Early Christians preserved a continuity of worship from the Old Covenant to the New, employing elements from the Jewish Temple liturgy, the synagogue liturgy and the rituals of the Jewish home. Shows how divinely revealed Old Testament worship is not only continued but also fulfilled in the Orthodox liturgy. A line-by-line explanation of the liturgy is included
