### Description
In the East, by contrast, the term "catholic" was used to designate the Church, while individual Christians were most often called "Orthodox," "those of true faith," in opposition to the heretics. Finally, during the Middle Ages, one spoke more and more of the "Orthodox Church," now in contrast to Roman "Catholicism."In the ecumenical debate, the Orthodox Church then presents herself as the guardian of the true faith, that of the apostles and the Fathers of the Church. As a condition of union, she proposes a return of all Christians to this one unique faith, the faith of the first ecumenical councils.Our book, therefore, will have a double goal: that of presenting the Orthodox Church—its past and its present state—to Western readers who, with rare exceptions, have only a very limited knowledge of her, and that of enticing the Orthodox themselves to an examination of conscience which they very much need.In our presentation, we will follow the historical development of the Orthodox Church from the apostolic time to our own. It is the interpretation we will give to the stages of this history which will permit the reader to understand the essential dogmatic positions of Orthodoxy. The basic dogmas about Scripture and Tradition, about the Church and ecclesiastical authority, will thus be defined in the opening chapters. At the conclusion of the book, we will return to certain other doctrinal aspects in the forms in which they are expressed today.This is therefore not a systematic exposé of Orthodox faith which we are attempting here but a general introduction to the past and present life of the Orthodox Church.
